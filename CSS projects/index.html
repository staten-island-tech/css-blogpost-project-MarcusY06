    <p class="text1">
      It was a normal day. A Hololive EN collab featuring Gawr Gura and Mori
      Calliope. They were playing TTRPG, when Calli asked Gura was 4+2 was. She
      quickly answered 6, showing a rare moment of her being able to do math
      correctly.

    <h2 class="header">Nanashi Mumei Opens up YouTube Membership</h2>
    <p class="text3">
      On September 24th, 2021, Nanashi Mumei officially opened up her YouTube
      membership. She showed us the benefits and emojis that we were able to use
      in her chat and comments if we got it. Unfortunately, the celebration was
      short-lived. Mumei was not feeling well and ended the stream early. The
      celebration was later held at September 29th, 2021, 9 PM EST.
